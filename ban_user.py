"""
Bans a user: adds them to the permanent banned_users table in
master_userlist.db. This is a soft ban only -- it does NOT delete or touch
any of their existing records. Their users/agent_assignments/
balance_adjustments rows, and their deposits/withdrawals/wallet_transactions/
bonuses rows, keep existing and keep updating normally as new activity comes
in; the ban only makes build_deposit_report.py exclude them from every
report, listing, export, and the user-search index (see the
"report_daily_db_path"/"report_master_db_path" filtered-copy logic in its
main()) -- so they're fully invisible on the dashboard without losing any
history. Unban with unban_user.py.

Triggered by the "Ban User" widget on the dashboard's Search User page (via
the master-userlist-upload worker's /ban-user endpoint) -- same pattern as
reassign_agent.py.

Usage: python3 ban_user.py --user-id 12345
