"""
Pulls deposit, withdrawal, and wallet-detail exports directly from the business
API (dlmanagers.online) and ingests them, instead of waiting for a manual file
upload. Runs on a schedule via GitHub Actions (see .github/workflows/api_pull.yml).

Deposits and withdrawals: always fetch a rolling 5-day window (today - 4 days
through today, IST) since an order created days ago can still complete, fail,
or get rejected later. ingest_update.ingest_deposits/ingest_withdrawals now use
INSERT OR REPLACE, so re-fetching the same order id with an updated status
overwrites the stale row instead of being ignored.

Wallet details: single-day export. Uses `today` (IST) on every run, except the
first run after the IST calendar date has rolled over, which uses `yesterday`
once (to finalize the previous day's data) before switching to `today` for the
rest of that day. Which date was last covered is persisted in R2 at
reports/wallet_fetch_state.json so this survives across independent runs.

The API bearer token is not a GitHub secret -- it's stored in R2 at
config/business_api_token.txt and can be updated any time via the "Business
API Token" form on the upload page, without touching GitHub settings.

master_userlist.db (VIP level, total deposit, new user_ids) is also kept
current on every pull via sync_master_userlist() -- see its docstring.

         correction can't be recorded as a wallet_transactions row and
         expect it to stick, since change_after is an absolute balance set
         by the source platform on every real row, not a delta we control,
         so the next real transaction would just overwrite it regardless
         of where in time it's placed.
      2. Adds newly-seen COMPLETE deposits to each user's total_recharge, and
         newly-seen Complete (status 2) withdrawals to their total_withdrawal
         -- both lifetime, permanent totals on master_userlist.db, never
         subject to daily_records.db's 33-day purge. Dedicated
         deposit_sync_time/withdrawal_sync_time columns (not the real
         update_time/review_time fields, to avoid conflicting with genuine
         userlist re-uploads) track how far each has already been counted,
         so re-fetching the same rolling window on every run never
         double-counts.
      3. Bumps last_active_time for any user touched by a deposit,
         withdrawal, or wallet transaction more recent than their current
         value -- again, only writes when it actually moves forward.
      4. Inserts a minimal row for any user_id seen in ANY of the three
         sources but not already in the table (phone/city/channel only
         available when the insert is deposit-sourced).

    withdrawal_rows are the FULL rows (not just an activity timestamp) since
    total_withdrawal needs the actual amounts -- withdrawals is a modest
    table (thousands/day, not the tens-of-millions wallet_transactions can
    reach), so fetching it fully is cheap. wallet_activity stays a
    precomputed {user_id: latest create_time str} from a GROUP BY MAX query
    in main(), since wallet_transactions really is too large to fetch
    row-by-row here.

    Also (re)derives the permanent daily_performance rollup (see
    compute_and_save_daily_performance) once per day, from the FULL
    currently-retained deposit_rows/withdrawal_rows (up to 33 days) -- this
    is what makes total_deposit/total_withdrawal/net_revenue trends survive
    past daily_records.db's 33-day purge, instead of being capped at it.

    Skipping no-op writes (instead of touching every row every run
    unconditionally) is what keeps this run's SQLite write volume, and
    therefore its runtime/GitHub Actions billed minutes, proportional to
    what actually changed rather than to the full user table every time.

    Also detects "reactivation candidates" and "VIP upgrade candidates":
    users active/upgraded TODAY compared against a stable snapshot of their
    state as of the START of today. This can't just compare "before this
    run" vs "after this run" -- the pipeline runs hourly, and each run's
    report is freshly regenerated (not cumulative), so a naive per-run diff
    would silently lose an event from an earlier run the same day (e.g. a
    user who reactivates at 10am would show in the 10am report, but by 2pm
    their last_active_time already says "today" so they'd wrongly disappear
    from the 2pm report). Instead, a (vip_level, total_recharge,
    last_active_time) snapshot is taken once, on the first run of each
    calendar day, into the daily_snapshot table, BEFORE any of today's
    updates are applied -- every run for the rest of the day compares
    current state against that same stable snapshot. daily_snapshot also
    keeps FUNNEL_HISTORY_DAYS of rolling history (not just today) so
    build_deposit_report.py can compute N-day conversion funnels ("of users
    who were near-upgrade/inactive N days ago, how many have since
    converted") -- daily_records.db's own deposits/withdrawals/wallet
    tables are purged to a rolling 33-day window and don't carry enough
    signal for that on their own.

    Returns (changed, reactivation_candidates, vip_upgrade_candidates) --
    changed is True iff at least one row was actually inserted or updated
    this run. vip_upgrade_candidates is {"low": [...], "high": [...]}."""
