    "Weekly Data Comparison & Target" Excel report's Week-on-Week +
    Target vs Actual sheets, computed fresh from the SAME daily new/old

    queries). Compares the CURRENT calendar week (Monday-Sunday, however
    many days have elapsed so far) against the most recent FULLY COMPLETE
    prior week (exactly 7 retained days) -- so the comparison is always
    "this week's pace so far" vs "last week's final result," never two
    partial weeks against each other.

    On Monday/Tuesday, "current week" instead means the week that JUST
    ENDED (still shown as a full, final 7-vs-7 report) rather than the
    brand-new week that's only 1-2 days old -- same "grace period before
    cutover" idea as weekly_cashback_week_range() above (which holds the
    display on the just-completed week through Sunday evening), just a
    2-day window instead of a same-day time cutoff, so admins get Monday
    and Tuesday to review last week's finished numbers before the section
    flips to tracking the new week's early pace on Wednesday.

    "However many days have elapsed" always excludes today itself -- today
    is still accumulating deposits with every hourly pipeline run, so a
    partial day would understate the average next to fully-finished prior
    days. The current week's average is only ever built from yesterday

def bonus_claim_report(bonus_rows_all, deposit_rows, deposit_challenge_bonus_rows, target_dates, agent_by_user):

    (Welcome Back, Loyalty, VIP tiers, Daily Active, etc., from
    daily_records.db's `bonuses` table) and the 3-Day Deposit Challenge
    Bonus (Rules 1-4). For each: claimed users, total bonus value, how many
    of those claimers ALSO made a COMPLETE deposit at any point that same
    day (a same-day "did the bonus convert into a deposit" signal) plus the
    actual amount they deposited (not just the headcount -- two converters
    aren't equally valuable if one deposited Rs200 and the other
    Rs20,000), and the resulting %.

    Called once per retained date (see main()'s bonus_claims_by_date loop)
    so the dashboard's date filter can browse any day in the retention
    window, not just today -- bonus_rows_all is fetched ONCE by the caller
    and reused across every call, rather than re-querying daily_records.db
    per date. The permanent bonus_performance rollup (see
    compute_and_save_bonus_performance in api_pull_ingest.py) still tracks
    lifetime history for each category regardless of what this specific
    view surfaces.

    Learning about new bonuses: `bonuses` is populated by classify_bonus()
    (in ingest_update.py) under five confirmed rules -- a real bonus name
    in game_name with blank source (category = game_name); game_name
    literally "Elle Import Excel Add", using source_id for the real bonus
    identity (e.g. "Daily Active Low VIP"); blank game_name with "bonus"
    in source_id, rolled up into combined "Daily Active Bonus"/"Daily
    Active Bonus Low" categories (stripping the random per-instance
    suffix); blank game_name with source_id starting "WEEKLY_SIGN",
    rolled up into "Weekly Check-IN Bonus"; or blank game_name AND blank
    source with source_id starting "GiftCode-", rolled up into "System
    Gift" (the label the business admin's own wallet-details view shows
    for these). Any bonus matching one of these rules is picked up
    automatically the first day it appears -- no maintained name list, no
    code change needed.

    target_dates is an iterable of 'YYYY-MM-DD' strings -- a single day for
    the Day view, or a rolling 7/30-day window for the Week/Month views
    (see bonus_claims_by_week/bonus_claims_by_month in main()). Using a set
    keeps "claimed users" a true distinct count across the whole window
    rather than a sum-of-daily-counts that double-counts repeat claimers.

    "Deposited After" (wallet bonuses only -- these have a real claim
    create_time; Deposit Challenge Bonus rows only carry an fd_date, no
    claim timestamp, so they keep the same-day check below) means a
    COMPLETE deposit strictly AFTER that specific claim's own timestamp,
    not merely a deposit on the same calendar date -- a user who deposited
    at 9am and claimed a bonus at 6pm the same day did NOT convert off
    that bonus, even though both events fall on the same target date. The
    per-category aggregate measures this once per user, against their
    EARLIEST claim of that category in the window, so a user who re-claims
    the same category more than once in a Week/Month view doesn't get the
    same later deposit counted as "converted" multiple times over."""

# Powers the "Performance" leaderboard: for each agent, per criterion, how
# much they achieved vs a daily target. Two shapes:
#   "count" -- a flat per-day headcount target (e.g. 7 reactivations/day).
#     Stored per day as (actual_count, target_count) so a date range just
#     sums both sides: pct = SUM(actual) / SUM(target) * 100.
#   "rate"  -- a percentage-of-cohort target (e.g. 30% retention). Stored
#     per day as (converted_count, cohort_size) -- NEVER the target itself
#     -- so a date range sums the raw counts and recomputes the TRUE
#     weighted rate (SUM(converted) / SUM(cohort) * 100), rather than
#     naively averaging daily percentages, which would be wrong whenever
#     cohort size varies day to day. That weighted rate is then compared
#     against the flat target here to get "% of target achieved".
